# Plotting complex orbitals from cube file data

![Isosuface of the absolute value of a complex orbital, with surface colored by the complex phase](orbitalplot-example.png)

A Mathematica notebook for plotting the isosurface of the absolute value
of a complex orbital. The isosurface is colored with the complex phase
of the orbital according to the color wheel shown below. 

Works (should work) with Mathematica 12.1 or higher.
