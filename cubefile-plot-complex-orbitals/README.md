# Plotting complex orbitals from cube file data

![Isosuface of the absolute value of a complex orbital, with surface colored by the complex phase](orbitalplot-example.png)

A Mathematica notebook for plotting the isosurface of the absolute value
of a complex orbital. The isosurface is colored with the complex phase
of the orbital according to the color wheel shown below. 

The functionality was used to generate the orbital visuals in this article:

Works (should work) with Mathematica 12.1 or higher. 

The notebook is also available at the Wolfram Foundation's Notebook
