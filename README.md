# Mathematica notebooks

In this repository, I provide a collection of Mathematica notebooks that
I developed for our research projects. If you use and adapt them for your
own research, I would appreciate it if you cite some of the references 
provided in the README files in the subdirectories or in the Mathematica notebooks themselves.
