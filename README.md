# Mathematica notebooks

This repository provides a collection of Mathematica notebooks that
I developed for our research projects. If you use and adapt them for your
own research, I would appreciate it if you cite some of the references 
provided in the README files in the sub-directories or in the Mathematica notebooks themselves. 

The collection of notebooks includes the following (yes, I'm a chemist ... ;-): 

https://github.com/jautschbach/mathematica-notebooks/tree/main/crystal-field-hamiltonian : Given the coordinates and charges of the ligands surrounding a metal center in a complex, this notebook will calculate the one-electron crystal-field (CF) Hamiltonian, the spin-orbit (SO) Hamiltonian for a p-, d- or f-shell, and the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues for the combined CF and SO interaction. 

https://github.com/jautschbach/mathematica-notebooks/tree/main/cubefile-plot-complex-orbitals : Given the real and the imaginary part of a complex molecular orbital (MO) in separate 'Cube' format files, this notebook will visualize the complex MO by drawing an isosurface of the MO's absolute value and color it by the complex phase of the MO at the isosurface points. The molecular frame is visualized together with the isosurface. 

https://github.com/jautschbach/mathematica-notebooks/tree/main/tensor-plots : Given a molecular structure in XYZ format, and a rank-2 tensor, this notebook visualizes the tensor in the form of a polar diagram along with the molecule.
