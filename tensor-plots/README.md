# Plotting rank-2 tensors

![Image of finite carbon nanotube with two NMR shielding tensor plots](tensorplot.png)

A Mathematica notebook for plotting graphical representations of NMR shielding tensors; easily adaptable for other types of rank-2 tensors (EFG, Optical Rotation, â€¦). The figure shown above displays carbon NMR shielding tensors in a finite model of a (9,0) carbon nanotube. Relevant publications are these: http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jp803180v , http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/cmr.a.20155

A description and some examples can be found here: https://ja01.chem.buffalo.edu/tutorials/tensorgraphics.html

There are two versions of the notebook. One works with Mathematica 12 (and, hopefully, higher). The other one works with version 11 and older, perhaps as old as 6.0). The xyz file is read by either version of the notebook.
